# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VIDHI (Voice-Integrated Defense for Holistic Inclusion) is an AI-powered mobile and web application designed to empower Indian citizens by providing accessible legal guidance, government scheme discovery, and document analysis capabilities. The system addresses the critical gap in legal literacy and government service awareness, particularly for citizens in urban areas who even though have access to internet and latest technologies are not quiet aware of their basic rights and how to efficiently and confidently handle police interactions.
